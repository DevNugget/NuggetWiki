**Case Study**
KLG is based in country X, it specializes in making electrical parts which it sells to washing machine manufacturers in country X. The managing director is planning to relocate to country Y which is a low cost country. "This will allow us to pay employees low wages for working low hours, as there are few legal controls on employment and health and safety. KLG cannot be both ethical and profitable. Changes in exchange rates, import tariffs and quotas and other protectionism methods, might cause KLG problems when exports start".

**Questions**
1. What is meant by import Tariffs? *(2 Marks)*
* This is a tax on imported products.

2. What is meant by Protectionism? *(2 Marks)*
* Protectionism is where the government introduce some barriers to entry on imports and exports, such as quotas and embargos in order to protect domestic business from foreign competition.

3. Explain how exhange rates might affect KLG when exporting. *(6 Marks)*
* If the exhange rate appreciates, exports would be expensive so that exporting electrical parts to washing machine manufacturers in country X will be reduced. This is mainly due to country X not buying electrical parts from KLG, and they will buy from another competitor in the same market. On the other hand, when there is an exchange rate depreciation, exports would be cheaper and so, the business enjoy with lots of benefits as they can generate a good sales revenue and also it would be easier for KLG to expand by relocating in country Y which is a low cost country. This leads to exports becoming expensive or cheaper for KLG when changes in exchange rate occurs.

4. Identify and explain two advantages to KLG relocating to country Y. *(4 Marks)*
* Advantage 1: Low cost of production
* Explanation: Since country Y is a low cost country, KLG can buy raw materials to produce electrical parts for cheaper prices and KLG can pay lower wages to their exployees, which decreases their cost of production.

5. Discuss whether KLG needs to be concerned about being both ethical and profitable. Justify your answer *(6 marks)*
* Ethics are the moral guidelines that KLG needs to follow when they are making business decisions. If KLG is concerned about ethical practises, they will have to train their workers accordingly and need to find some ways to attract ethical customers towards the business, therefore being ethical would be expensive to KLG, which would reduce profits in the long run. On the other hand, if KLG wants to increase profits, they will not be concerned about ethical practises as it would add to the business costs. Profit is the difference between, total costs and total revenue, therefore if KLG wants to increase profits, they need to minimize the costs which would add to KLG as much as possible, therefore KLG cannot be both ethical and profitable.
